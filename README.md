## Installation

### Cloning and installing dependencies

Clone the project from the url, enter to the project folder and install the dependencies.

```bash
  cd weather-app
  yarn install
```

### Getting the API KEY

After that create a file into the root project folder called .env. Inside add your API_KEY that you can get for free on https://www.weatherapi.com/.

The file should look like this.

```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY=c08ca7fa27ea453fb2c145802242312
```

This is an example key. This one isn't working, you have to get your own.
